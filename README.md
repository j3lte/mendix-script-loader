# Script Loader

![AppStoreIcon](/assets/MarketPlaceIcon.png)

Load scripts in your Mendix page/layout

## Features

- Load javascript files from an external source
- Execute action on load/error
- Execute action when all are loaded
- Load scripts in parallel or sequential order

## Important note

> While you can load external scripts (like we do in out demo), you should be aware that the script might not work, or more importantly: mess with the Mendix runtime in your page.

For example:
- Loading jQuery works fine
- Loading Lodash seems to not work properly. The script loads fine, but when the page tries to load Javascript Actions, it breaks

So, if you have issues with your Mendix application when you are using the Script Loader widget, check if any of the loaded scripts interfere with the app itself.

## Usage

Import the Script Loader widget in your page (or preferably, your layout), set the different options (should be intuitive) and let it run.
